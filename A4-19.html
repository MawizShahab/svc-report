              Social Return on Investment (SROI) is a comprehensive framework
              and methodology used to measure and quantify the social,
              environmental, and economic value created by an organisations
              activities and initiatives. It assesses the impact of investments
              or actions by examining both the tangible and intangible outcomes
              they produce. SROI helps organisations understand and communicate
              the broader value they provide to society, stakeholders, and
              communities by translating their efforts into a ratio that
              represents the social benefit generated for every unit of resource
              invested. It is a valuable tool for decision-making,
              accountability, and demonstrating the positive contributions made
              toward social and environmental well-being.
